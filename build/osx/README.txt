                           Mac OS X edition


Installation
============

1. Open stop.app. This will stop any running LWFS instance.
2. Remove previously installed LWFS applications.
3. Copy this folder onto your drive, such as under /Application.

Note on recent OS X.
------------------
Recent OS X requires an apple script downloaded "to be signed," but
start.app and stop.app here are not signed. For now after extracting
LWFS*.zip, please execute below on the terminal:

  xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine LWFS


Start/Stop LWFS
===============

* Open start.app to start LWFS.
* Open stop.app to stop LWFS.
